# Transport ICM
Investigative case management solution for citizens, police officers, drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web using Klaytn, ZKP and sCrypt eco-system, Aleo blockchain and tools.


Our app solution will enable effective design, engineering and delivery of ZKP and scrypt aided solution powered by Klaytn to make roads safer and better using predictive analytics and automation for incident reporting and reduction in hazardous transportation with capabilities pluggable and extendable to 5 different personas: Driver, Police, Citizen, Dispatcher, Admin.

Our solution will benefit: Police Force - 360 degrees access of the incidents to the action/ administration team. They can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, traffic monitoring, managing police teams. Using machine learning they can also predict the incident occurrence at any area. This will help in taking necessary actions in advance to control the traffic. They can also use the solution for effective utilization of staff members and provide road safety counselling.

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the car accident scenario by use of car technology to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, as well as other 3rd parties. With a mix of hardware and software, we will provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents.

Citizens and Cab aggregators: Reduction in the number of road accidents.

Insurance Companies: Aggregated/ anonymized driving data and incident data will be helpful to car insurance companies.

OEMs and Dealerships: Vehicle diagnostics and in-car service consumption will be helpful for OEMs and Dealerships.

Smart Cities Policy Makers/ Government: Real time traffic flow, incident alert and parking data will be enable safer roads.

Advertisers: Customers/driver demographics will be available.

Fleet customers: fleet performance, compare against competition.


# What it does

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn blockchain, IPFS decentralized storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy.

Our technical solution enables driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behaviour (complete view of the car with 2 cameras â€“ front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source solutions and ASDI OpenAQ dataset along with ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn blockchain. We are also utilizing ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Aleo blockchain to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the incident reports so that they can prevent incidents. Further, we have developed a DeFi dashboard for the riders and the insurance providers.

Klaytn Rider Monitor is a DeFi dashboard that allows riders to search their address and view their vehicle token holdings and balance, also available is the ability for riders to view their vehicle NFT holdings and their balance(s) and price if available: https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Monitor/tree/main/electronicincidentmanagement/Klaytn-rider-monitor

Any abnormal behaviour/activity can be displayed on the smart dashboard in the vehicle.

Built-in GPS technology useful in fleet management and tracking. Black box car tracking to be able to pre-empt and diagnose breakdowns more quickly. Recognition area built in the central control to pick up your body movements, GAIT analysis Vehicles become IoT devices which can connect to smartphones, take voice commands, change the user interface.

The decentralized Cloud-Connected Car Drives IoT Monetization. Real-time access to car availability and mobile connectivity enables better decisions making systems.


# How we built it

We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using open source video streaming system, ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo blockchain solution, Klaytn blockchain, ASDI OpenAQ ((https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/openaq.yaml) and crowdsourcing marketplace enabled by ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control powered by SocialCalc.

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn integration, IPFS for snapshots of road incident, Bitcoin based wallet for toll ticketing, data retrieval.

Object Detection using open source AWS solutions, air quality measurements with ASDI OpenAQ and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, ZKP and scrypt aided solution on Bitcoin based solutions for security and for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source AWS for streaming, ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn for security and for snapshots.

Alarm storage using IPFS with ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn network, ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn protocol based solutions for security and for data retrieval. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using decentralized wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAO tooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

We are also utilizing ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users, government officials on the incident reports so that they can prevent incidents.

ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution and Klaytn's license NFT registration module is to enable users to register their driving licenses as well as their vehicle registration details in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by his/her SSN and a vehicle by Vehicle Registry Number both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). Every SSN or individual is associated to an address of an individual Bitcoin account. We are developing our own NFT smart contract from the ground up following ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Aleo blockchain and the key tutorial shared at the github website. We are also logging the identities of the driving license owners, their vehicle assets using exchange of unique identifiers powered by ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution powered by Klaytn.

ZK Transport wallet supports operations like the signing of the transaction and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability. We used Zokrates for building the ZK Transport Wallet.
