# What it does

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Gnosis Blockchain and analytics tooling, dev tooling and services, ZKP and scrypt aided EtherSpot and Azuro network, IPFS decentralized storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy.

Our technical solution enables driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behaviour (complete view of the car with 2 cameras – front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source solutions and ASDI OpenAQ dataset along with Gateway RPC end points, ZKP and scrypt aided solution. We are also utilizing ZKP and scrypt aided solution, blockchain to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the incident reports so that they can prevent incidents. Further, we have developed a DeFi dashboard for the riders and the insurance providers.

We are also extending an auction example for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Transport-Monitor/tree/main/contract-management 


- Etherspot:  Account Abstraction Plugins for Transport DAO enables customization of verification logic via Etherspot's Transaction Builder with a rule/logic setting, tabulation, organization, visualization tool namely SocialCalc spreadsheet. This allows users to set up rules which their account has to abide by when executing transactions while being able to reconfigure them in the future. The process improves account security by restricting permissions certain keys have while remaining adaptable to the user's changing needs.
Implementation areas of Account Abstraction plugins in Transport DAO using EtherSpot's Transaction Builder and Socialcalc:

- Enforcing a spending limit for vital transport assets based on the key used for the transaction.

- Restricting interaction with a certain citizen wallet or DAO dApp to a specific key.

- Defining session keys, which are allowed to initiate service or repair transactions for only a limited period of time

Gateway: We are using Gateway RPC end points for Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behaviour (complete view of the car with 2 cameras – front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source solutions and ASDI OpenAQ dataset along with Gateway RPC end points.

We are also using gateway RPC end points to enable providing government subsidies for greener fuel and pollution check credits. Government organizations can send crypto from source-chain to destination-chain and distribute it equally among all accounts specified for subsidy or reimbursement using call contract with token. 

Any abnormal behaviour/activity can be displayed on the smart dashboard in the vehicle.

Built-in GPS technology useful in fleet management and tracking. Black box car tracking to be able to pre-empt and diagnose breakdowns more quickly. Recognition area built in the central control to pick up your body movements, GAIT analysis Vehicles become IoT devices which can connect to smartphones, take voice commands, change the user interface.

# How we built it

We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using Gnosis Blockchain and analytics tooling, open source video streaming system, ZKP aided Gnosis blockchain solution, Etherspot's Transaction builder, Request network and Gateway RPC end points,  Eth blockchain, ASDI OpenAQ ((https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/openaq.yaml) and crowdsourcing marketplace enabled by ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control powered by SocialCalc.

Vehicle Spare Parts Marketplace on Gnosis blockchain: Vehicle spare parts NFT marketplace on Gnosis blockchain for NFC tags of spare parts of vehicles, enabling sharing of government assets and service/repair of vital assets, reduction in counterfeiting of vital spare parts of vehicles and transport infrastructure. 

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn integration, IPFS for snapshots of road incident, Bitcoin based wallet for toll ticketing, data retrieval.

Object Detection using open source AWS solutions, air quality measurements with ASDI OpenAQ and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, ZKP and scrypt aided solution on Bitcoin based solutions for security and for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source AWS for streaming, ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn for security and for snapshots.

Alarm storage using IPFS with ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Klaytn network, ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn protocol based solutions for security and for data retrieval. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using decentralized wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAO tooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.

We are also utilizing ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution, Klaytn to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users, government officials on the incident reports so that they can prevent incidents.

ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution and Klaytn's license NFT registration module is to enable users to register their driving licenses as well as their vehicle registration details in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by his/her SSN and a vehicle by Vehicle Registry Number both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). Every SSN or individual is associated to an address of an individual Bitcoin account. We are developing our own NFT smart contract from the ground up following ZKP and scrypt aided solution, Aleo blockchain and the key tutorial shared at the github website. We are also logging the identities of the driving license owners, their vehicle assets using exchange of unique identifiers powered by ZKP and scrypt aided Aleo solution powered by Klaytn.

ZK Transport wallet supports operations like the signing of the transaction and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability. We used Zokrates for building the ZK Transport Wallet.
